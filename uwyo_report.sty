%%% =============================================
%%% This file defines macros and parameters used for preparing reports
%%% for Dr. Wright's courses at the University of Wyoming using LaTeX2e.
%%% There is no guarantee given or implied that it will meet all your 
%%% particular requirements, but is should come very close. 
%%% Only minor adjustments in the TeX file should be needed to meet all
%%% requirements. In most cases this style file should *never* need 
%%% modification; all changes should be done via the TeX file.
%%%
%%% This file is typically distributed with a skeletal
%%% LaTeX file "uwyo_report_sample.tex" that provides a sample structure 
%%% of a report and provides an example of how to use this package.

%%% Usage:
%%% ======
%%%
%%% This file must be loaded as a package in the main document preamble.
%%% Note that we don't use the LaTeX "report" class for such a short document.
%%% This is how it should look:
%%%
%%% \documentclass[12pt]{article} 
%%% \usepackage{uwyo_report}
%%%
%%% You can also include other packages if you want, such as:
%%% \usepackage{amsmath}  % loads extra math symbols
%%% \usepackage{amssymb}  % also loads amsfonts
%%% \usepackage{subfigure} % places multiple EPS files in one figure
%%%
